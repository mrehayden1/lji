How it works
============

Linear Jazz Improvisation is a method to meaningful improvisation for musicians. You systematically create melodies, rehearse, and then edit later by keeping what you like when you play live.

Program Input
-------------

This program takes a music chart with an optional melody, which it then methodically targets with chromatic targeting groups you provide by extracting and chromatically tageting four principle lines: the melody (if supplied), the bass and the two guide tone lines.

For example, this is the song Autumn Leaves with a simplified melody.
